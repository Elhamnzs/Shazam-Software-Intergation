- Before starting the app, you need to generate the database of hashes using the script as follow   

    ``` bash
    python algorithms.py
    ```


- Once it is done, launch the app from `main.py`
- You will be able to record a song, and the process will be done automatically and at the end you will get a window that displays the best match for your recorded song.
